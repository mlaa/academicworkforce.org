Organized in 1997, the Coalition on the Academic Workforce (CAW) is a group of higher education associations, disciplinary associations, and faculty organizations committed to addressing issues associated with deteriorating faculty working conditions and their effect on college and university students in the United States. CAW collects and disseminates information on the use and treatment of full- and part-time faculty members serving off the tenure track and the implications for students, parents, other faculty members, and institutions; articulates and clarifies differences in the extent and consequences of changes in the faculty within and among the various academic disciplines and fields of study; evaluates the short-term and long-term consequences of changes in the academic workforce for society and the public good; identifies and promotes strategies for solving the problems created by inappropriate use and exploitation of part-time, adjunct, and similar faculty appointments; and promotes conditions by which all faculty members, including full- and part-time non-tenure-track faculty members, can strengthen their teaching and scholarship, better serve their students, and advance their professional careers.

A symposium on the 2010 CAW survey of contingent faculty members took place at the 2011 annual meeting of the Association for the Study of Higher Education (ASHE) in Charlotte, North Carolina, where representatives of the Coalition on the Academic Workforce (CAW) discussed initial findings from the survey. CAW collected usable responses from over 25,000 individuals. CAW thanks everyone who completed the questionnaire; we look forward to sharing results from the survey in the spring of 2012.-->

<P>Are you a non-tenure-track postsecondary faculty member, instructor, researcher, or graduate student? The Coalition on the Academic Workforce invites all members of the contingent academic workforce in US colleges and universities to participate in this survey. The survey inquires about fall 2010 course assignments, salaries, benefits, and general working conditions as members of the contingent academic workforce experience them at the institutional level. We invite participation from all instructional and research staff members employed off the tenure track, including faculty members employed either full- or part-time, graduate students remunerated as teaching assistants or employed in other roles, and researchers and postdoctoral fellows.</P>
