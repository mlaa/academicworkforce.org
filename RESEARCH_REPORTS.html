			A Portrait of Part-Time Faculty Members: A Summary of Findings on Part-Time Faculty Respondents to the Coalition on the Academic Workforce Survey of Contingent Faculty Members and Instructors (2012) 
			</div>	
                                                <a href="/survey.html">http://www.academicworkforce.org/survey.html</a>

                                                <p>
In an effort to address the lack of data on contingent faculty members and their working conditions, the Coalition on the Academic Workforce (CAW) ﬁelded an ambitious survey in fall 2010, seeking information about the courses these faculty members were teaching that term, where they were teaching them, and for what pay and beneﬁts. The survey received close to 30,000 responses, with more than 10,000 coming from faculty members who were teaching part-time at an institution or institutions of higher education in fall 2010.  The responses from these part-time faculty members provide the basis for a detailed portrait of the work patterns, remuneration, and employment conditions for what has long been the fastest-growing and is now the largest part of the academic workforce.

The CAW issue brief calls on
institutions of higher education to work toward ensuring that all college and university faculty members
are recognized and supported as professionals committed to providing a quality education to all students.
“One Faculty Serving All Students” calls for improvements in the current staffing ratios at colleges and
universities, increased support for faculty members serving in contingent positions, and inclusion of all
faculty members in the work and life of their institutions.

In a session entitled “‘Come Together’: Part-Time/Contingent Faculty in History,” committee members analyzed the changing composition of the modern higher education faculty, the viability of the 2003 AHA-OAH Joint Standards on Part-Time and Adjunct Employment, the need to define contingent faculty more precisely, and the virtue of affording them greater respect and a larger role in faculty governance.

                                                    Linda K. Kerber, president of AHA and faculty at
                                                    University of Iowa who was once contingent faculty herself, uses this April
                                                    2006 Perspectives article to "reveal and publicize the hidden costs of reliance
                                                    on contingent faculty." She counts history among the disciplines least reliant
                                                    on contingents, citing Robert Townsend's data analysis for AHA showing that
                                                    only 9 percent of all history faculty are neither tenured already or in
                                                    tenure-track positions. This number does not properly represent the information
                                                    she later includes here: that 25 percent of all history faculty at four-year 
                                                    schools is part-time and that just 57 percent of those at two-year colleges are 
                                                    tenured or on the tenure track.  Kerber instead uses  
                                                    her piece to emphasize the shifting definition of contingent faculty members, 
                                                    which sometimes includes teaching graduate students and sometimes does not, and  
                                                    widening the problem to employment in history outside the university, which has 
                                                    also become subject to the economic forces that make non-permanent positions 
                                                    administratively appealing.

                                                    This March 2006 Perspectives article discusses history-specific data from 
                                                    the 2003 NSOPF, most notably that part-time faculty decreased by just over 7  
                                                    percent at four-year colleges and universities while full-time faculty 
                                                    increased by just over 33 percent since the 1998 NSOPF. Part-time 
                                                    faculty were 25.1 percent of the teaching population at
                                                    four-year colleges and universities in 2003. Two-year colleges were a different
                                                    story, with an 8.4 percent decrease in full-time positions and an 11.2 percent
                                                    increase in part-time positions. While these numbers do not reflect the full
                                                    body of contingent faculty as defined by CAW, this piece goes on to include
                                                    data on tenure-line faculty, just 56.7 percent of history faculty at either
                                                    two- or four-year institutions. The report also compares history to other

It examines the situation of adjunct professors in U.S. higher education today and puts forward an agenda around which they can mobilize to transform their jobs and their institutions.

                                                    This 2000 report from the American Philosophical Association begins with a
                                                    discussion of two problems and statements of priorities that are relevant to
                                                    contingent faculty. First, the organization admits that it does not have
                                                    current, discipline-specific staffing data often requested by members. Their
                                                    1994 member survey required extensive volunteer work on the part of the
                                                    membership, especially as they have a small national office staff at the University
                                                    of Delaware. They recommend that
                                                    the organization strategize to improve data collection for many of its top
                                                    concerns. Its top stated concern, immediately following this statement on data,
                                                    is contingent faculty, which they describe as "part-time and adjunct faculty." Here,
                                                    they discuss the growing concern about contingents in academia, particularly
                                                    the humanities, but they couple this with their lack of data on that subject.
                                                    They recommend the formation of a special task to focus on contingent faculty
                                                    and begin to manage this issue in-house.

                                                    workforce data gathered by their StatisticalResearch Center
                                                    in the spring of 2004. They found that full-time hiring has increased an
                                                    average of 1 percent per year since 1994, but that those positions have become
                                                    increasingly contingent since 1998, with 1 in 5 physics professors serving in
                                                    full-time, non tenure-line positions as of this survey. Some data on percent of
                                                    part-time faculty is also included here, but their primary focus is full-time
                                                    staffing. A good deal of gender and racial breakdown information is also
                                                    included for many of the categories within the academic workforce represented.

                                                    September, these data show faculty statistics in real numbers in tables and
                                                    figures and save percentages for the extensive discussion attached. The

                                                    report. In 2004 the number of non tenure-track full-time appointments was up 45
                                                    percent from 1998, with part-time faculty up 19 percent, and tenure-line
                                                    faculty down 1 percent. This data was collected from math departments at
                                                    four-year schools in fall 2004.

                                                    the position of women and minorities in classics, the data also reveal trends
                                                    in positions offered and to whom. Notably, an increase in the number of

                                                    This 2004 research brief on contingent faculty in sociology uses data from
                                                    the 2000-2001 ASA survey of departments (all supplied by department chairs) to
                                                    examine "size, scope, and costs and benefits of those faculty members referred
                                                    to as supplementary." They front their discipline-specific data with general
                                                    figures from NSOPF (2002) and AAUP (2003); this early discussion also carefully
                                                    defines their terms and describes analytic methodology, including their
                                                    inclusion of graduate student teaching faculty in the supplementary category
                                                    and of non tenure-line, full-time faculty in the full-time category. With these
                                                    specifications, 61.9 percent of all sociology  faculty
                                                    were full-time in AY 2000/2001, with the other 38.1 percent of faculty
                                                    categorized as supplementary. They have found that full-time numbers are
                                                    stable, but that both student enrollments and, subsequently, supplementary 
                                                    faculty numbers are rising. This report includes a variety of data on 
                                                    supplementary faculty, including that they teach a total of 22.5 percent of  
                                                    sociology courses and have average salaries well below the CAW-recommended 
                                                    $3000 per course. The final sections discuss the reasons such faculty are

                                                    breakdown and characteristics including gender, education level, and race,

                                                    contingent faculty and "traditional" to refer to full-time, tenure-line faculty
                                                    as they present their analysis, which includes a look at how the academic
                                                    workforce has grown since the 1980s and explores some reasons administrators
                                                    have made the staffing decisions that have increased non-tenure line faculty so

                                                    This 2001 report shares comprehensive results from AAA's 1999 survey of
                                                    anthropology departments, portions of which were included in the larger CAW
                                                    survey report from AHA. Pay, other benefits, and staffing structures were at
                                                    issue in the AAA survey. According to this survey, just over half of all
                                                    anthropology instructors were then full-time, tenure-track faculty members, and
                                                    the majority of the remaining  faculty were either
                                                    part-time contingent faculty or graduate assistants. The percentage of
                                                    full-time contingent faculty was very small (less than 6 percent), showing a
                                                    different trend from many other disciplines. The report is comprehensive and
                                                    includes discussions and tables for all figures, including an early section on
                                                    response rates for all the CAW-based surveys done at this time.
